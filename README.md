TETWinSamples
====

This is the C# samples repository for The Eye Tribe Tracker.

More samples will be added to the repository in the near future.


Calibration
----

The calibration sample can be used to perform a user-based calibration on the system.


Scroll
----

The Scroll sample is a demostration of how to employ natural scroll interaction while reading information-dense content (e.g., websites). Changing the information content is done with the mouse. A mouse-button down invokes a gaze-sensitive menu with selectable items and a mouse-up signals a selection to the application.



Most samples make use of TETCSharpClient.dll and TETWinControls.dll. The code for these DLLs is provided in https://github.com/EyeTribe/TETCSharpClient and https://github.com/EyeTribe/TETWinControls respectively.
